Sound, sand, and a sharp object. The woman called Leonie Ania realizes consciousness in a subterranean, starchy hotel room. Low ceilings. Thick, hazy air that tastes like the hot burn of an overzealous teenager’s bitten-out words. \t \tHer first thought: To exit. Irrational, she knows, yet as she feels sand uncomfortably rubbing up between each crevice down her body, she realizes that she does not know much of anything at all.   \tLeonie sits up very straight in the slatted cot. Slowing her breathing, she can hear muffled voices outside the room. A singular voice, if separated from the mass, sounds ghastly and atoned. When combined, the voices compose desperate brays of a deathbed’s song. No, she decides, those aren’t voices that I know.  \tLeonie tends to know a lot of things. But not right now.  \tThere’s a mirror slightly to the left of her blurred vision. She glances at her disheveled self, giving her familiar body a heavy look. Leonie’s all dressed up in the last party dress she remembers putting on, her glittered features matching the style she had done for a friend’s special occasion, shoes gone, her hair up in an extravagant flair done once for a celebration years back. These are all her memories, but they don't align. She doesn’t even recognize the little room.  \tShe climbs out of the bed, not bothering with the sheets. Material permanence is something she’s always struggled with; she tends to believe things just disappear when they’re out of her sight.   \tMaybe they do. She decides not to look at the stained mattress any longer. \" width=\"962\" height=\"898\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<p id=\"text16\"><em>FEBRUARY 2023</em>: <strong>\"THE XLUA'TAM, WORSHIPPERS OF THE YUXIA-MITJE\"</strong>, Excerpt from <em>The Guide to Kibstolya</em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/833866530483339306/1152800835978399754/image.png?width=1094&amp;height=1004\" alt=\"An alternate denomination derived from the general Common beliefs. Transcribed from the Common Kibos personal pronouns and use of the word “you”, the Xlua’tam consider themselves the inner spirits and descendants of the monarch Rik’tjet, a distant acquaintance of the more commonly known monarch Kibsil. Rik’tjet, known to the Xlua’tam as the Empress Mother (Kibos: Yxia-Mitje /yuuhia michae/), is not only their goddess, subject of worship, but also their caretaker.  Xlua’tam reject the notion of Kibsil being the world’s creator, and rather, believe he is solely the world’s destructor. Kibsil is not respected or revered, instead, he is known as the Anti-life, (directly translating to “no child” — Pam’eyuha). Through this, Xlua’tam also believe that those identifying as Monarchs are evil, while others are gracious, warrior beings — called the Empresses. The religion is complete with complicatedly spectacular tales of Rik’tjet and her Empress’s Army conquering worlds destroyed by evil Monarchs, similar to the power-hungry and overconfident Kibsil. The Xlua’tam are mainly confined to Alsnah, Manyx, and some parts of Abercia, but constant reports of Upper Southern groups immigrating to Pathway Northern cities have created a thriving Xlua’tam community in places like Cherlen in Magdefaire, and most notably, a rather large group that traveled to the city of Cocendi in the Sasdren region, many a hundred years previous. Interestingly, the Xlua’tam do not possess a specific story of creation — they believe the world was spun by the Universe’s Empresses at some point, and the Empresses were spun from stars. Note the derivation of the Kibos word yxi, meaning star, directly transcribing to the word yxia, meaning empress. The Kibos word for Monarch is a sharp contrast both in sound and meaning — “ik’sep”, a heavily bilabial word.  While the Xlua’tam believe the world was weaved into existence by the Empresses, they don’t forget to mention, in their oral tale “the Will of Hers” — xlua saet, that the Monarchs were not created by the fierce Empresses, instead, remnants from a more violent time before.\" width=\"566\" height=\"520\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"container04\" class=\"container columns\">\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<p id=\"text14\"><span class=\"p\"><em>DECEMBER 2022:</em> <strong>\"Reflections on the Iris\"</strong> <em>(contemporary Korean sijo)</em></span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833866530483339306/1152800958825369600/image.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"383\" height=\"71\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<hr>\n<p id=\"text10\"><em>JANUARY 2023</em>: <strong>\"KYODORIJI: LAND OF THE MALVI RIVER\"</strong>, Excerpt from <em>The Guide to Kibstolya</em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833866530483339306/1152801211792240710/image.png\" alt=\"Bordering the far more populous land of Mira, the mineral-rich Kyodoriji is home to a tribe with thriving traditions and culture: the Kyodor.

I am Korean-American, and I say I reside in DC, but actually live in Northern Virginia.<br id=\"ispmk\" draggable=\"true\" data-gjs-type=\"default\"><br id=\"idehx\" draggable=\"true\" data-gjs-type=\"default\">Subjects I appreciate are politics, East Asian history, protest art, art history, feminist thought, and philosophy. I like visiting used bookstores, libraries, and video game shops. I write surrealistic, bizarre prose often with horror elements exploring the linearity of progress. I also like fiction and fandom such as Stardew Valley, Homestuck, visual novels, and rhythm games.</p>",
