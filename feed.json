            "content_html": "\n<p>Hi! My name is Micha, and I'm 15. I spend much of my time researching abstruse affairs, worldbuilding, and reading. I am Korean-American, and I say I reside in DC, but actually live in Northern Virginia.<br id=\"ispmk\" draggable=\"true\" data-gjs-type=\"default\"><br id=\"idehx\" draggable=\"true\" data-gjs-type=\"default\">Subjects I appreciate are politics, East Asian history, protest art, art history, feminist thought, and philosophy. I like visiting used bookstores, libraries, and video game shops. I write surrealistic, bizarre prose often with horror elements exploring the linearity of progress. I also like fiction and fandom such as Stardew Valley, Homestuck, visual novels, and rhythm games.</p>",
